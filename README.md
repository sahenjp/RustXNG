# RustXNG

[日本語](README.ja.md) · [한국어](README.ko.md)

RustXNG is a self-hosted metasearch engine written in Rust, based on [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng). It combines results from external search providers and can fetch page text for AI agents through a JSON API or MCP.

RustXNG does not maintain a web-scale search index. You can add a local index of selected sites with `rustxng-index` and import Wikipedia dumps separately.

## Quick start

Install from the [releases page](https://github.com/sahenjp/RustXNG/releases) or with Cargo. Release binaries are available for Linux, macOS and Windows; check the matching asset and its SHA-256 sidecar before running it.

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/sahenjp/RustXNG.git --tag v0.28.0 --locked
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Rust 1.88 or newer and a C build toolchain are required for source installation. The [agent setup guide](docs/AGENT-SETUP.md) covers release binaries, verification, platform requirements and service reuse.

Start a local server:

```bash
rustxng --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 29483
```

Search from another terminal:

```bash
curl --fail --get 'http://127.0.0.1:29483/search' \
  --data-urlencode 'q=tokio runtime documentation' \
  --data 'format=json' --data 'max_results=5'
```

Results contain a title, URL, snippet and source metadata. Useful optional parameters include `language=ja`, `engines=wikipedia`, `include_domains=docs.rs`, `exclude_domains=example.com`, `time_range=day`, and `include_raw_content=1`. Time filtering depends on provider support.

The web interface is at <http://127.0.0.1:29483/>. The search endpoint also supports CSV, RSS and HTML output.

## Use from an AI agent

Start the built-in MCP server:

```bash
rustxng mcp
```

MCP exposes two read-only tools:

- `search` returns up to 10 ranked results. The default is 5, with snippets limited to 500 characters.
- `read_page` retrieves text from a URL returned by `search` in the same session. It can return up to three passages relevant to an optional `query`, selected from the extracted page.

`read_page` returns 4,000 characters by default and allows `max_chars` up to 20,000. Use `offset` and `next_offset` to continue. `truncated` and `source_truncated` indicate limits. MCP enforces serialized character and byte budgets, **not a tokenizer-specific token budget**.

Page fetching checks destinations and redirects for non-public addresses and follows robots.txt (RFC 9309). It does not accept arbitrary URLs through MCP. Treat all returned web text as untrusted content.

For page text, `include_raw_content=1` uses the HTTP API. PDF text extraction requires Poppler (`pdftotext`); scanned PDFs require a separate OCR tool. JavaScript-rendered pages need the optional [Firefox renderer](tools/page-renderer/README.md). Neither is enabled automatically by a standalone release binary.

## Search profiles

Choose a provider configuration with `--profile`. The default is `standard`.

| Profile | Command | Sources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | `rustxng` | Default keyless providers, excluding selected disallowed or blocked sources |
| Clean | `rustxng --profile clean` | Selected public APIs and locally indexed sites |
| Full | `rustxng --profile full` | Additional HTML providers, including sources with restrictive or unverified automation terms |

**Full is not a permission bypass.** Do not enable a provider without the permissions required for your use. A private instance does not override provider terms. Clean is a configuration choice, not a certification of legal compliance.

The selected profile also works with MCP, for example `rustxng mcp --profile clean`. Optional API-backed providers may require keys and incur charges. Search queries are sent to the enabled external providers even when RustXNG runs locally.

The [provider policy and inventory](docs/PROVIDERS.md) documents known limitations. I previously emphasized performance before checking every provider's conditions. That was a mistake; provider reviews remain ongoing.

## Installation and configuration

A Docker image is available:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:29483:29483 \
  -e SEARXNG_PORT=29483 ghcr.io/sahenjp/rustxng:latest \
  --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 29483
```

By default, the service binds to loopback. Exposing it to another network requires appropriate access controls.

Settings are embedded. Provide only overrides in a TOML file:

```bash
rustxng --config settings.toml
```

An explicit settings file overrides the chosen profile, so avoid copying the entire default file unless that is intentional. Use `rustxng --check-update` to check for a release or `rustxng --update` for a supported binary installation. For managed packages and containers, use the original installation method.

The `/healthz` endpoint checks the process, not the availability of upstream providers. Use a real JSON search to verify that results are returned. Runtime metrics are exposed at `/stats` and `/metrics`.

## Search quality and limitations

The [November 4, 2026 comparison](docs/COMPARISON-2026-11-04.md) measures Standard, Clean and Full on 100 documentation questions and 254 SealQA questions. For example, the documentation set measured Hit@10 of 88, 61 and 98 respectively, with the local index used in the recorded environment.

These are reference-page retrieval results, **not the accuracy of generated AI answers**. The benchmark sets informed development, the local index overlaps with tested documentation sites, and stored Exa/Tavily results were not collected at the same time. Do not treat those scores as universal rankings or current guarantees.
